               "\"Creamy and Crunchy feature stories of Jif, Skippy, Peter Pan; the plight of black peanut farmers; the resurgence of natural or old-fashioned peanut butter; the reasons why Americans like peanut butter better than (almost) anyone else; the five ways that today's product is different from the original; the role of peanut butter in fighting Third World hunger; and the Salmonella outbreaks of 2007 and 2009, which threatened peanut butter's sacred place in the American cupboard. To a surprising extent, the story of peanut butter is the story of twentieth-century America, and Jon Krampner writes its first popular history, rich with anecdotes and facts culled from interviews, research, travels in the peanut-growing regions of the South, personal stories, and recipes.\"--Provided by publisher.",

               "\"Peanuts have become one of the best money crops for use in rotation with cotton and other farm crops in the fight against the boll weevil. Until recently peanuts were grown in the greater part of the gulf coast region primarily for stock feeding, but now they are of commercial importance in no less than 12 Southern states. Good seed, proper preparation of the soil, frequent cultivation of the crop, proper harvesting and curing and grading the product according to standard grades are the main essentials to the realization of a profit from peanuts. Most failures have been due to the neglect of one or more of the above essentials. Many losses have resulted from the practice of windrowing the peanut vines for curing instead of stacking them around small poles. Peanuts are in increasing demands for oil manufacture and for making many other peanut products. It is always safe for the Southern farmer to grow peanuts, as every part of the crop can be used to advantage for feeding on the farm in case the market does not justify their sale. A closer working relation between growers and dealers is desirable, and the establishment of standard grades will do much towards stabilizing the industry.\"--Page [2].",
